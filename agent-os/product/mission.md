# Product Mission

## Pitch
FBLA Membership Tracker is an internal chapter management system that helps FBLA chapters streamline operations by providing centralized member data management, automated attendance tracking via QR codes, and real-time requirements monitoring to ensure members maintain good standing.

## Users

### Primary Customers
- **FBLA Chapter Members**: Students who need to track their participation, view requirements, and monitor their standing status
- **Chapter Administrators**: E-Board members and advisors who manage chapter operations, track member engagement, and generate reports

### User Personas

**Active FBLA Member** (14-18 years)
- **Role:** High school student participating in FBLA activities
- **Context:** Balancing FBLA commitments with academics and other extracurriculars
- **Pain Points:** Unclear on current standing status, missing event notifications, unsure of requirements for their membership level
- **Goals:** Maintain good standing, track competition participation, easily check into events

**E-Board Administrator** (16-18 years)
- **Role:** Executive Board member responsible for chapter operations
- **Context:** Managing 50-200 chapter members while being a full-time student
- **Pain Points:** Manual attendance tracking is time-consuming, difficulty monitoring member engagement, generating reports for advisors takes hours
- **Goals:** Automate administrative tasks, quickly identify at-risk members, provide data-driven insights to advisors

**Chapter Advisor** (25-65 years)
- **Role:** Faculty advisor overseeing FBLA chapter
- **Context:** Managing FBLA chapter alongside full teaching responsibilities
- **Pain Points:** Limited visibility into member engagement between meetings, manual tracking of competition participation, ensuring compliance with FBLA requirements
- **Goals:** Monitor chapter health at a glance, ensure members meet requirements, simplify reporting to school administration

## The Problem

### Manual Chapter Management is Overwhelming
FBLA chapters rely on spreadsheets and paper sign-ins to track 50-200 members across dozens of events annually. This results in 10+ hours weekly spent on administrative tasks that could be automated.

**Our Solution:** Automated tracking system with QR code check-ins and real-time dashboards that reduce administrative overhead by 80%.

### Members Lack Visibility into Their Status
Students often discover they're not in good standing only when it's too late to correct. 30% of members become inactive due to missed requirements they weren't aware of.

**Our Solution:** Personal dashboards showing real-time progress against requirements with automated notifications before deadlines.

### Disconnected Data Silos
Event attendance, competition results, and member data live in separate systems. Generating comprehensive reports requires manual data consolidation taking 3-5 hours.

**Our Solution:** Unified platform integrating all chapter data with one-click report generation and Google Calendar synchronization.

## Differentiators

### Purpose-Built for FBLA Chapters
Unlike generic membership software, we understand FBLA's unique structure with hierarchical membership types, specific requirement categories, and competition tracking needs. This results in 50% faster onboarding and immediate value delivery.

### Mobile-First QR Check-In
Unlike paper sign-ins or complex check-in apps, our QR system works on any smartphone without app installation. This achieves 95% attendance capture accuracy in under 30 seconds per event.

### Intelligent Status Monitoring
Unlike static spreadsheets, we automatically calculate member standing based on dynamic requirements. This provides real-time alerts allowing 75% of at-risk members to return to good standing.
