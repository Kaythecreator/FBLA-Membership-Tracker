## 🚀 Next Steps for Team

1. **Choose simplified docs** - Use the "-simplified" versions
2. **Start with app.py** - Everything in one file is OK!
3. **Week 1 goal** - Just get login working
4. **Test by using it** - No complex test suites
5. **Ask for help** - Google, ChatGPT, teammates!

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

### For Student Developers:
- **This is a learning project** - mistakes are OK!
- **50-60 users** - not 5,000, so keep it simple
- **3 weeks part-time** - be realistic about time
- **Working beats perfect** - ship something!

### What Success Looks Like:
✅ No more paper sign-ins at meetings
✅ E-Board can track attendance
✅ Team learned web development
✅ Something to put on resume
✅ Had fun building it!

## 📌 Quick Reference

When in doubt, remember:
1. **Simple is better** - One file? That's fine!
2. **SQLite is enough** - No complex database needed
3. **Bootstrap = instant pretty** - Don't write custom CSS
4. **Sessions > JWT** - Easier to implement
5. **Local hosting works** - Run on a laptop during meetings
